**Text Adventure Game Documentation**
### Overview:

The "TextAdventureGame" is a Java program that simulates a text-based adventure game set in a mystical forest. Players navigate through choices presented in the console, interacting with various characters and encountering challenges along the way. The game includes features such as decision-making, combat mechanics, quest objectives, and a scoring system.

### Design:

1. **Modular Structure**:
   - The code is organized into multiple methods, each responsible for handling different aspects of the game (e.g., handling player choices, combat, quest progression).
   - This modular design promotes code readability and maintainability.

2. **Object-Oriented Design**:
   - The game utilizes object-oriented principles by encapsulating related functionality into methods within the "TextAdventureGame" class.
   - Private variables are used to maintain game state (e.g., score, health, treasure status).

3. **User Input Handling**:
   - User input is obtained using the `Scanner` class, allowing players to input choices through the console.
   - Input validation is implemented to ensure that the player's choices are within the expected range.

4. **Game Flow**:
   - The game follows a linear narrative with branching paths based on player choices.
   - Each decision point presents the player with options that influence subsequent events and outcomes.

### Features:

1. **Choice-Based Gameplay**:
   - Players make decisions that impact the progression and outcome of the game.
   - Choices include selecting paths, engaging in combat, accepting quests, and interacting with NPCs.

2. **Combat Mechanics**:
   - Players engage in turn-based combat with mystical creatures encountered during the adventure.
   - Combat options include attacking with different moves and defending against enemy attacks.

3. **Quests and Objectives**:
   - Players can embark on quests, such as retrieving a magical artifact, to advance the story.
   - Quest progression is determined by player choices and outcomes during gameplay.

4. **Scoring System**:
   - A scoring mechanism tracks the player's performance throughout the game.
   - Score increases based on successful actions (e.g., finding treasure, completing quests) and decreases upon failure (e.g., losing battles).

5. **Health Management**:
   - Players have a health attribute that decreases during combat encounters and certain events.
   - Health status affects the player's ability to continue the adventure and influences game endings.

6. **End Game State**:
   - The game concludes with a summary of the player's final score and health.
   - Players are provided with feedback on their performance and outcomes based on their choices.

### Conclusion:

The "TextAdventureGame" offers an immersive text-based gaming experience, allowing players to embark on an adventure filled with exploration, decision-making, and strategic combat encounters. With its modular design, engaging features, and interactive narrative, the game provides an entertaining experience for players to enjoy.
